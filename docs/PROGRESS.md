## üêõ Known Issues

- **Keyboard Focus**: The overlay window may lose keyboard focus when other applications are clicked. The `Ctrl+Shift+Q` shortcut only works when the overlay has focus. Future enhancement: implement global hotkey registration.

- **Multi-Monitor Support**: Current implementation uses `WindowState="Maximized"` which may not span all monitors in a multi-monitor setup. Needs testing and potential enhancement.
